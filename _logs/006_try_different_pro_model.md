# 006 - Try Different Pro Model
Date: 2025-01-16
Type: Debug

## The Problem
- Still getting "The string did not match the expected pattern" with Pro model
- Error appears to be client-side, not from API

## What I Changed
- Enhanced frontend error handling to show more details
- Added console logging for debugging
- Tried different Pro model name: `gemini-2.0-pro-exp`
- Made thinkingConfig conditional (only for Flash models)
- Pro models might not support thinkingConfig parameter

## Code Locations
- index.html:75: Changed Pro model to gemini-2.0-pro-exp
- index.html:467-477: Better error parsing and logging
- index.html:483-485: Added debug console logs
- api/analyze.js:111-113: Added new Pro model config
- api/analyze.js:178-183: Made thinkingConfig conditional

## Hypothesis
1. The original Pro model name might not exist
2. Pro models might not support thinkingConfig
3. Pro models might need different API parameters

## Testing Notes
- Try with gemini-2.0-pro-exp model
- Check browser console for detailed errors
- If still fails, thinkingConfig will be excluded for Pro

## Next Steps
- If this doesn't work, try removing all extra parameters for Pro
- Check Google's documentation for available models
- Consider using only Flash model if Pro is not available
