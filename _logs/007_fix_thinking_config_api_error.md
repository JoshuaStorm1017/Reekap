# 007 - Fix ThinkingConfig API Error
Date: 2025-01-17
Type: Debug

## What I Fixed
- Removed `thinkingConfig` parameter that was causing 400 errors from Gemini API
- API was rejecting the parameter with "Unknown name 'thinkingConfig': Cannot find field"
- Removed unused MODEL_CONFIGS object that was only used for thinking budgets

## Key Decisions
- Decided to remove thinkingConfig entirely rather than try different placements
- Research showed Gemini 2.5 models have thinking enabled by default
- thinkingConfig is optional and only needed for explicit control over thinking budget
- Since the API was rejecting it, better to rely on default behavior

## Code Locations
- `/api/analyze.js`: Removed thinkingConfig from geminiRequest (lines 175-182)
- `/api/analyze.js`: Removed MODEL_CONFIGS object (lines 99-117)

## Testing Notes
- Test that both Flash and Pro models work without thinkingConfig
- Verify meeting analysis still produces quality results
- Check that thinking is still happening by default (quality of outputs)

## Next Steps
- Monitor if removing explicit thinking budget affects quality
- If needed, research alternative ways to configure thinking
- Consider adding error handling for model-specific features
