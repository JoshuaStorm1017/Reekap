# 005 - Fix Pro Model Error
Date: 2025-01-16
Type: Debug

## The Problem
- Pro model (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05) returns "The string did not match the expected pattern"
- Flash model works fine
- Error occurs when using Pro model with Training Lecture

## Investigation
- Added logging to track model being used
- Fixed incorrect default model name
- Added better error handling and logging
- Cleaned up MODEL_CONFIGS to remove invalid model

## Root Cause (Hypothesis)
The Pro model name might not be valid or might require different API parameters. Need to verify:
1. Is "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05" the correct model ID?
2. Does Pro model support thinkingConfig?
3. Is there a different API endpoint for Pro?

## What I Changed
- api/analyze.js:92: Fixed default model to 'gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20'
- api/analyze.js:100-107: Removed invalid model config
- api/analyze.js:109: Fixed fallback model reference
- api/analyze.js:179: Added logging for model being used
- api/analyze.js:191-193: Already has error logging for debugging

## Verification Needed
- Check Vercel logs to see exact error from Gemini API
- Verify Pro model name is correct
- Test if Pro model works with business meetings (not just training)

## Next Steps
- Monitor Vercel logs for detailed error message
- May need to check Google's documentation for correct Pro model ID
- Consider adding fallback to Flash if Pro fails
