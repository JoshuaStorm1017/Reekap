## Sharing With Your Team

- That's all they need!

## Troubleshooting

**"Invalid passcode" error**
- Check you typed the exact passcode you set in Step 3
- Capital letters matter!

**"Failed to analyze transcript"**
- Check your AI key is correct
- Make sure you selected a meeting type
- Try a shorter transcript first

**Can't find the REEKAP folder**
- It's wherever you saved these files
- Usually in Downloads or Desktop

## Need a Custom Domain?
Instead of "amazing-curie-a1b2c3.netlify.app", want "ba-assistant.com"?
1. In Netlify, go to "Domain management"
2. Click "Add a domain"
3. Follow the steps (costs ~$15/year)

## Questions?
- Netlify has great support chat
- The app works on phones too!

## Security Notes
